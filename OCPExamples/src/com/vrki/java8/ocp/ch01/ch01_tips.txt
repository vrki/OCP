* Access Modifiers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Careful with 'package' access:

This can be very tricky!

package cat;
public class BigCat {
	public String name = "cat";
	protected boolean hasFur = true;
	boolean hasPaws = true;
	private int id;
}

package cat.species;
public class Lynx extends BigCat { }

If we have situation like this and try to access 'directly' to hasPaws from Lynx class it will not work!

BigCat cat = new BigCat();
System.out.println(cat.hasPaws);

The reason is that we access the variable directly not through inheritance. The variable hasPows is visible only through classes 
via inheritance or in by same package. If we access the variable 'hasPaws' through inheritance like this:

Lynx cat - new Lynx();
System.out.println(cat.hasPaws);

Everything will be OK! Because this is access through inheritance instead of directly through instance of BigCat class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Overloading and Overriding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both occur only when method name is the same!

Overloading:
Method parameters must vary by the type and/or number. When multiple overloaded methods are present, Java looks for the closest 
match first:
- Exact match by type
- Matching a superclass type
- Converting to a larger primitive type
- Converting to an autoboxed type
- Varargs
[see Overloading.java in the same package]

Overriding:
Occurs only when method signature is the same (method name and parameter list). There are few rules:
- The access modifier must be the same or more accessible.
- The return type must be the same or a more restrictive type, also known as "covariant return" types.
- If any checked exceptions are thrown, only the same exceptions or subclasses of those exceptions are allowed to be thrown.
- The methods must not be static. (If they are the method is hidden and not overridden.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Abstract Classes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An abstract class is not required to have any methods in it, let alone any abstract ones.

Abstract method has keyword 'abstract' and a semicolon instead of a method body:
abstract void clean();

In abstract classes we also can have default implementation like this;
void clean () {}

The first concrete subclass of an abstract class is required to implement all abstract methods that were not implemented by a 
superclass.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Static and Final
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 'final' prevents a variable from changing or a method from being overridden.
- 'static' makes a variable shared at the class level and uses the class name to refer to a method.

- 'static' and 'final' (a class cannot be subclassed) are allowed to be added on the class level too.

As with methods, a class cannot be both abstract and final.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Imports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'sort()' method is a static method in a java.util.Collections package. To use it you should do static import. You can do it on 
either way:
import static java.util.Collections.sort; 	// You can do it like this.
import static java.util.Collections.*; 		// Or like this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Using instanceof
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a instanceof B, the expression returns true if the reference to which a points is an instance of class B, a subclass of B 
(directly or indirectly), or a class that implements the B interface (directly or indirectly).

All Java classes inherit from Object, which means that x instanceof Object is usually true, except for one case where it is 
false. If the literal null or a variable reference pointing to null is used to check instanceof, the result is false. null is 
not an Object.

The compilation check only applies when instanceof is called on a class. When checking whether an object is an instanceof an 
interface, Java waits until runtime to do the check. The reason is that a subclass could implement that interface and the 
compiler wouldn't know it.

The instanceof operator is commonly used to determine if an instance is a subclass of a particular object before applying an 
explicit cast.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Understanding Virtual Memory Invocation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

virtual method invocation: They are just regular non-static methods. Java looks for an overridden method rather than necessarily 
using the one in the class that the compiler says we have.

Java looked at the actual type of an object at runtime and called method on that.

Instance variables don't work this way! (They cannot be overridden)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Annotating Overridden Methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Java, when you see code that begins with an '@' symbol, it is an annotation. An annotation is extra information about the 
program, and it is a type of metadata. It can be used by the compiler or even at runtime.

The @Override annotation is used to express that you, the programmer, intend for this method to override one in a superclass or 
implement one from an interface. You don't traditionally think of implementing an interface as overriding, but it actually is 
an override.

@Override is allowed only when referencing a method. Just as there is no such thing as overriding a field, the annotation cannot
be used on a field either.

It is great idea to get in the habit of using @Override in order to avoid accidentally overloading the method!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Coding equals, hashCode, and toString
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* toString
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reflection is a technique used in Java to look at information about the class at runtime.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* equals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Override public boolean equals(Object obj)
	if ( !(obj instanceof Lion)) return false;
	Lion otherLion = (Lion) obj;
	return this.idNumber == otherLion.idNumber;
}

- First, pay attention to the method signature! It takes an Object as the method parameter rather than a Lion object (or some 
other object).
- As a first line in the method it checks whether a cast would be allowed using instamceof operator.
- After that you can implement some custom logic if the objects are "the same'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* hashCode
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever you override equals(), you are also expected to override hashCode(). The hash code is used when storing the object as a 
key in a map.

A hash code is a number that puts instances of a class into a finite number of categories.

Contract for hashCode():
- Within the same program, the result of hashCode() must not change.
- If equals() returns true when called with two objects, calling hashCode() on each of those objects must return the same result.
- If equals() returns false when called with two objects, calling hashCode() on each of those objects does not have to return a 
different result.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Working with Enums
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Java, an 'enum' is a class that represents an enumeration. It is much better than a bunch of constants because it provides 
type-safe checking.

Behind the scenes, an enum is a type of class that mainly contains static members. It also includes come helper methods (name(), 
...).

'Enums' prints the name when toString() is called. They are also comparable using == because they are like static final constants.  

An enum provides a method to get an array of all of the values:

public enum Season {
	WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL
}

for(Season season: Season.values()) {
	System.out.println(season.name() + " " + season.ordinal());
}	

output:
WINTER 0
SPRING 1
SUMMER 2
FALL 3

You can't comare an int and enum value directly. An enum is a type and not an int.

if (Season.SUMMER == 2) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE

You can also create an enum from a String. This is helpful when working with older code. The String passed in must match exactly, 
though.

Season s1 = Season.valueOf("SUMMER"); // SUMMER
Season s2 = Season.valueOf("summer"); // exception

The Exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. 

Another thing that you cannot do is to extend an enum:

public enum ExtendedSeason extends Season { } // DOES NOT COMPILE

*********************************************************************************************************************************
* Using Enums in Switch Statements
*********************************************************************************************************************************

Season summer = Season.SUMMER;

switch (summer) {
	case WINTER:
		System.out.println("Get out the sled!");
		break;
	case SUMMER:
		System.out.println("Time for the pool!");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("Is it summer yet?");
}

We just typed the value of the enum rather than writing Season.WINTER. The reason is that Java already knows that the only 
possible matches can be enum values (if you were typed case Season.WINTER, it would not compile).

*********************************************************************************************************************************
* Adding Constructors, Fields, and Methods  
*********************************************************************************************************************************

Semicolon at the end of the enum values is optional only if the only thing in the enum is that list of values.

Constructor in enums is executed only once - the first time when we ask for some value (Then Java constructs all of the enum 
values). After that, Java just returns the already-constructed enum values. Here is one of the examples:

public enum OnlyOne {
	ONCE(true);
	
	private OnlyOne(boolean b) {
		System.out.println("constructing");
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[] {
		OnlyOne firstCall = OnlyOnce.ONCE;	// prints constructing
		OnlyOne secondCall = OnlyOnce.ONCE;	// doesn't print anything
	}
}

This technique of a constructor and state allows you to combine logic with the benefit of a list of values.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
** Creating nested classes
*********************************************************************************************************************************

A nested class is a class that is defined within another class. A nested class that is not static is called an inner class.

There are four types of nested classes;
1. A member inner class - same level as instance variables, not static.
2. A local inner class - defined within a method.
3. An anonymous inner class - special case of local inner class without a name.
4. A static nested class - static inner class defined at the same level as static variables.

Benefits of using inner classes:
- Encapsulate  helper classes by restricting them to the containing class.
- Make it easy to create a class which will be used in only one place.
- Make the code easier to read.
- Make the code harder to read when used improperly.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
** Member Inner Classes
*********************************************************************************************************************************

- defined at the member level of a class (same level as the methods, instance variables and constructors).

Properties:
- can be declared as public, protected, private or default (access)
- can extend any class or interface
- can be abstract or final
- can access members of the outer class including private members
- cannot declare static fields or methods

Since a member inner class is not static, it has to be used with an instance of the outer class.

There is another way to instantiate Inner class:

public static void main(String args[]) {
	Outer outer = new Outer();
	Inner inner = outer.new Inner();	//  create the inner class
	inner.go();
}

We need an instance of Outer in order to create Inner. We can't just call new Inner() because Java won't know with which instance 
of Outer it is associated. Java solved this by calling new as if it were a method on the outer variable.

Inner classes can have the same variable names as outer classes. There is a special way of calling 'this' to say which class you
want to access. You also aren't limited to just one inner class.

public class A {
	private int x = 10;
	
	class B {
		private int x = 20;

	class C {
		private int x = 30;

		public void allTheX() {
			System.out.println(x); // 30
			System.out.println(this.x); // 30
			System.out.println(B.this.x); // 20
			System.out.println(A.this.x); // 10 
		}
	}	 
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
	A a = new A();
	A.B b = a.new B();
	A.B.C c = b.new C();
	c.allTheX();
	}
}

Private interfaces;

public class CaseOfThePrivateInterface {

	private interface Secret {
		public void shh();
	}
	
	class DontTell implements Secret {
		public void shh() { }
	}
}

The rule that all methods in an interface are public still applies. A class that implements the interface must define that method
as public.
The interface itself does not have to be public, though. Just like any inner class, an inner interface can be private. This means
that the interface can only be referred to within the current outer class.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
** Local Inner Classes
*********************************************************************************************************************************
 
A local inner class  is a nested class defined within a method.
This method can return an instance of the local inner class.

Properties:
- They do not have an access specifier.
- They cannot be declared static and cannot declare static fields or methods.
- They have access to all fields and methods of the enclosing class.
- They do not have access to local variables of a method unless those variables are final or effectively final.

The compiler is generating a class file from your inner class. A separate class has no way to refer to a local variables. If the 
local variable is final, Java can handle it by passing it to the constructor of the inner class or by storing it in the class 
file. If it weren't effectively final, these tricks wouldn't work because the value could change after the copy was made. Up 
until Java 7, the programmer actually had to type the final keyword. In Java 8, the "effectively final" concept was introduced.
If the code can still compile with the keyword final inserted before the local variable, the variable is effectively final.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
** Anonymous Inner Classes
*********************************************************************************************************************************

An anonymous inner class is a local inner class that does not have a name.
It is declared and instantiated all in one statement using the new keyword.
Anonymous inner classes are required to extend an existing class or implement an existing interface. 
They are useful when you have a short implementation that will not be used anywhere else.

Example:

public class AnonInner {
	abstract class SaleTodayOnly {
		abstract int dollarsOff();
	}

	public int admission(int basePrice) {
		SaleTodayOnly sale = new SaleTodayOnly() {
			int dollarsOff() { return 3; }
		};
		
		return basePrice - sale.dollarsOff();
	}
}

Notice how this inner class does not have a name. The code says to instantiate a new SaleTodayOnly object. But wait. 
SaleTodayOnly is abstract. This is OK because we provide the class body right there - anonymously.
Pay special attention to semicolon at the end of that class body. We are declaring a local variable on these lines. 
Local variable declarations are required to end with semicolons, just like other Java statements - even if they are
long and happen to contain an anonymous inner class.

Remember that an anonymous inner class is just an unnamed local inner class.

There is one more thing that you can do with anonymous inner classes. You can define them right where they are needed, even if
that is an argument to another method:

public class AnonInner {
	interface SaleTodayOnly {
		int dollarsOff();
	}

	public int pay() {
		return admission(5, new SaleTodayOnly() { 
			dollarsOff() { return 3; }
		});
	}
	
	public int admission(int basePrice, SaleTodayOnly sale) {
		return basePrice - sale.dollarsOff();
	}
}

*********************************************************************************************************************************
** Static Nested Classes
*********************************************************************************************************************************

A static nested class is a static class defined at the member level. 
It can be instantiated without an object of the enclosing class, so it can’t access the instance variables without an explicit 
object of the enclosing class. For example, new OuterClass().var allows access to the instance variable var.

In other words, it is like a regular class except for the following:
- The nesting creates a namespace because the enclosing class name must be used to refer to it.
- It can be made private or use one of the other access modifiers to encapsulate it.
- The enclosing class can refer to the fields and methods of the static nested class.

public class Enclosing {
	static class Nested {
		private int price = 6;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Nested nested = new Nested();
		System.out.println(nested.price);
	}
}

Since the class is static, you do not need an instance of Enclosing in order to use it. You are allowed to access private instance
variables.

Importing a static Nested Class:

You can import it using regular import:

package bird;
public class Toucan {
	public static class Beak {}
}

package watcher;
import bird.Toucan.Beak;	// regular import OK
public class BirdWatcher {
	Beak beak;
}


And since it is static, alternatively you can use a static import:

import static bird.Toucan.Beak;

Either one will compile. Java treats the static nested class as if it were a namespace.
